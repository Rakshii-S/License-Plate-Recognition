# License Plate Recognition
10 practical and structured scenarios for collecting license plate images

**Lighting Conditions**
1. Daylight (Sunny & Clear Sky) – Capture images under direct sunlight to analyze glare, shadows, and reflections on the license plate.
2. Daylight (Overcast/Cloudy) – Collect images with diffused natural lighting to see how even light distribution affects plate readability.
3. Nighttime (Streetlights & Ambient Lighting) – Take images under artificial lighting conditions where streetlights or nearby buildings provide illumination.
4. Nighttime (Vehicle Headlights Only) – Capture plates where the only major light source is the vehicle’s headlights, testing glare and reflections.

**Weather Conditions**
5. Rainy Weather (Day & Night) – Collect images in light and heavy rain, testing how raindrops, reflections, and windshield wipers affect plate visibility.
6. Foggy or Misty Conditions – Capture plates when fog or mist reduces visibility, testing contrast and plate detection accuracy.

**Vehicle & Traffic Conditions**
7. Stationary Vehicles (Parking Lots, Garages, and Roadsides) – Take images of parked vehicles in different orientations and angles.
8. Slow-moving Traffic (Traffic Signals, Toll Booths, Checkpoints) – Capture plates when vehicles are slowing down or stopping, ensuring variety in angles and slight motion blur.
9. Fast-moving Vehicles (Highways & Main Roads) – Take images of vehicles at high speeds to analyze motion blur and different angles.

**Obstruction & Visibility Challenges**
10. Partially Obstructed or Dirty Plates – Collect images where plates are partially covered by dirt, mud, snow, or objects like bike racks, testing recognition under challenging conditions.
